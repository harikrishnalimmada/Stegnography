# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements **image-based steganography** using Python to securely hide and retrieve secret messages within images.  
By modifying pixel values, data remains invisible while maintaining the original image appearance.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **LSB-based Steganography** for secure data hiding  
- **Password-protected decryption** to restrict unauthorized access  
- **Supports PNG & JPG formats** without significant quality loss  
- **Python & OpenCV-based implementation** for efficiency  

## 🔐 Usage  
- Run the script, input the **message and passcode**, and store it inside an image.  
- Retrieve the hidden message using the **correct passcode** for decryption.  

## ⚡ Future Enhancements  
- **AI-powered anti-steganalysis techniques**  
- **Integration with cryptographic encryption for added security**
